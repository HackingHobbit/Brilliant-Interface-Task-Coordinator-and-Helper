# AI Personality Implementation and Testing Plan

This document details the step-by-step plan for implementing and testing the layered AI identity system as described in the AI Personality Architecture. It includes code snippets, logic explanations, and program flow to guide development.

---

## 1. Implementation Phase

### Backend

#### 1.1 Identity Data Schema

- Create or update JSON schema files (e.g., `config/models/identity-schema.json`) to define the AI Person identity structure:

```json
{
  "id": "uuid-string",
  "coreIdentity": "BITCH",
  "role": {
    "name": "Personal Assistant",
    "description": "Assists with daily tasks and scheduling"
  },
  "personality": {
    "name": "Friendly Helper",
    "traits": ["supportive", "kind", "patient"],
    "avatar": "avatar_id_or_path",
    "voice": "voice_id_or_path"
  }
}
```

#### 1.2 APIs for Identity Management

- Implement REST or GraphQL APIs to:
  - Create new AI Persons with unique IDs.
  - Update role and personality layers.
  - Retrieve AI Person data by ID.

Example (Node.js/Express):

```js
app.post('/api/ai-persons', (req, res) => {
  // Validate input, generate UUID, save to DB
});

app.get('/api/ai-persons/:id', (req, res) => {
  // Fetch AI Person by ID
});
```

#### 1.3 Agent Initialization Integration

- Modify agent initialization logic to load identity layers from the database.
- Inject role and personality data into the chat context for prompt conditioning.

#### 1.4 Memory Management Enhancements

- Increase short-term memory buffer to hold at least 40 user and 40 AI messages.
- Implement long-term memory storage linked to AI Person ID.
- Design a specialized memory store for strictly learned facts.

### Frontend

#### 1.5 Avatar and Identity UI

- Update `Avatar.jsx` and related components to accept identity layers as props.
- Display avatar model, name, personality traits, and voice selection.
- Add UI controls for users to customize:
  - Role (dropdown or selection list)
  - Personality (preset or custom traits)
  - Voice (selection)
  - Display name

Example React snippet:

```jsx
function Avatar({ identity }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{identity.personality.name}</h2>
      <AvatarModel src={identity.personality.avatar} />
      <VoiceSelector selected={identity.personality.voice} />
      {/* Additional UI */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### 1.6 Core Identity Enforcement

- Ensure the core identity "BITCH" is displayed but immutable.
- Default AI Person and personality loaded on app start.

## 2. Testing Phase

### 2.1 Unit Tests

- Validate JSON schema correctness.
- Test unique ID generation.
- Test memory module functions.

### 2.2 Integration Tests

- Test API endpoints for identity CRUD operations.
- Verify agent initialization loads identity layers correctly.

### 2.3 UI Tests

- Test avatar and identity customization workflows.
- Verify UI reflects identity changes accurately.

### 2.4 End-to-End Tests

- Simulate user sessions to verify identity persistence.
- Test memory linkage and retrieval across sessions.

### 2.5 Performance and Regression Tests

- Ensure system stability under load.
- Verify no regressions in existing functionality.

## Program Flow Summary

1. User creates or selects an AI Person identity.
2. Backend generates or retrieves identity data with unique ID.
3. Agent initializes with identity layers injected into context.
4. Short-term memory buffers conversation exchanges (40 messages each side).
5. Relevant context is periodically summarized and stored in long-term memory.
6. Learned facts are stored in a specialized memory store.
7. Frontend displays avatar, personality, and role; allows customization.
8. User interactions update identity and memory as needed.
