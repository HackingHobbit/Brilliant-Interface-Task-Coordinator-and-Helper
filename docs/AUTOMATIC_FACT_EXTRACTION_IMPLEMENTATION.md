## Implementation Details

### 1. Enhanced Memory Manager (`ai/memory/memory-manager.js`)

#### **New Methods Added**:

**`extractAndStoreFacts(messages, aiPersonId)`**
- Processes conversation messages to extract facts
- Calls `extractFactsFromMessage()` for each user message
- Automatically stores extracted facts using existing `addFact()` method

**`extractFactsFromMessage(messageContent)`**
- Uses comprehensive pattern matching to identify:
  - **Personal Information**: Name, age, location, occupation, relationship status
  - **Preferences**: Likes, dislikes, hobbies, food preferences
  - **Goals**: Aspirations, current projects, learning objectives
  - **Relationships**: Family members, children, partners

**`extractAndStorePreferences(messages, aiPersonId)`**
- Detects communication style preferences (formal/casual)
- Identifies response length preferences (brief/detailed)
- Recognizes topic interests (technology, science, arts, sports, business, health)

**`processMessageForFacts(sessionId, aiPersonId, userMessage)`**
- Real-time fact extraction during conversations
- Immediate preference detection and storage
- Processes each message as it's received

**`getEnhancedContext(aiPersonId, currentMessage)`**
- Enhanced version of `getRelevantContext()`
- Includes recently extracted facts (last 10)
- Provides total fact count and last update timestamp

#### **Enhanced Consolidation**:
- `consolidateMemory()` now automatically calls fact and preference extraction
- Session-end processing includes comprehensive fact consolidation
- Improved conversation summaries with extracted information

### 2. Pattern Recognition System

#### **Personal Information Patterns**:
```javascript
// Name extraction
/(?:my name is|i'm|i am|call me|i'm called)\s+([a-zA-Z]+(?:\s+[a-zA-Z]+)?)/g

// Age extraction  
/(?:i'm|i am|my age is)\s+(\d{1,3})\s*(?:years?\s*old)?/g

// Location extraction
/(?:i live in|i'm from|i'm in|my location is|i'm located in)\s+([a-zA-Z\s,]+)/g

// Occupation extraction
/(?:i work as|i'm a|i am a|my job is|i work at|my occupation is)\s+([a-zA-Z\s]+)/g
```

#### **Preference Patterns**:
```javascript
// Likes/dislikes
/i (?:really )?(?:love|like|enjoy|prefer)\s+([a-zA-Z\s]+)/g
/i (?:really )?(?:hate|dislike|don't like|can't stand)\s+([a-zA-Z\s]+)/g

// Goals and aspirations
/(?:i want to|i plan to|my goal is to|i hope to|i'm planning to)\s+([a-zA-Z\s]+)/g
```

#### **Family and Relationship Patterns**:
```javascript
// Family members
/(?:my|i have a)\s+(husband|wife|boyfriend|girlfriend|partner|mother|father|sister|brother|son|daughter|child|children)/g

// Children count
/(?:my|i have)\s+(\d+)\s+(kids|children|sons|daughters)/g
```

### 3. Backend Integration (`core/backend/index.js`)

#### **Real-time Processing**:
- Modified `buildMessagesArray()` to be async
- Added real-time fact extraction call: `await memoryManager.processMessageForFacts()`
- Enhanced context retrieval: `memoryManager.getEnhancedContext()`

#### **Integration Points**:
```javascript
// Real-time fact extraction during conversation
await memoryManager.processMessageForFacts(sessionId, identity.metadata.aiPersonId, currentUserMessage);

// Enhanced context with extracted facts
const memoryContext = memoryManager.getEnhancedContext(identity.metadata.aiPersonId, currentUserMessage);
```

## Feature Capabilities

### 1. **Automatic Information Extraction**

**Personal Details**:
- User's name, age, location
- Occupation and work details
- Relationship status
- Family information

**Example Extractions**:
- "My name is John" → `User's name is John`
- "I'm 25 years old" → `User is 25 years old`
- "I live in New York" → `User lives in New York`
- "I work as a software engineer" → `User works as a software engineer`

### 2. **Preference Learning**

**Communication Preferences**:
- Formal vs. casual communication style
- Brief vs. detailed response preferences
- Topic interests and expertise areas

**Example Detections**:
- "Please be more formal" → Sets `communicationStyle: 'formal'`
- "Keep it short" → Sets `responseLength: 'short'`
- "I love programming" → Adds `technology` to interests

### 3. **Contextual Integration**

**Enhanced Conversation Context**:
- Recently extracted facts included in AI prompts
- User preferences applied to response generation
- Relationship information used for personalization

**Memory Summary**:
- Total fact count tracking
- Last update timestamps
- Categorized fact organization

## Data Storage Structure

### **Extracted Facts Format**:
```json
{
  "fact": "User's name is John",
  "category": "personal",
  "addedAt": "2025-01-XX T XX:XX:XX.XXXZ",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "extractedFrom": "My name is John and I work as..."
}
```

### **Preferences Format**:
```json
{
  "communicationStyle": "formal",
  "responseLength": "detailed",
  "interests": ["technology", "science"],
  "lastUpdated": "2025-01-XX T XX:XX:XX.XXXZ"
}
```

### **Enhanced Context Format**:
```json
{
  "recentConversations": [...],
  "relevantFacts": [...],
  "recentFacts": [...],
  "preferences": {...},
  "relationships": {...},
  "totalFactsCount": 15,
  "lastFactUpdate": "2025-01-XX T XX:XX:XX.XXXZ"
}
```
