### 6.2 Session Management
✅ **Session Creation**
- New sessions created properly
- Session IDs generated correctly

## 7. System Stability

### 7.1 Backend Stability
✅ **Service Start/Stop**
- Backend starts without errors
- All modules load correctly
- Graceful shutdown works

### 7.2 Frontend Stability

- Personality behavior differences not tested

## 9. Performance Observations

- Frontend loads reasonably fast
- No performance degradation observed during testing

## 10. Recommendations for Future Testing

1. **Complete UI Testing**
   - Fix and test AI Person dropdown expansion
   - Test personality selection from dropdown
   - Test role switching functionality

2. **Memory Testing**
   - Verify memory isolation between AI Persons
   - Test conversation context switching
   - Verify fact storage per AI Person

3. **Behavioral Testing**
   - Test different personality responses
   - Verify role-specific behaviors
   - Test personality trait effects

4. **Load Testing**
   - Test with many AI Persons
   - Test with long conversations
   - Test concurrent sessions

## Summary

The AI Personality System implementation is largely functional with:
- ✅ All backend APIs working correctly
